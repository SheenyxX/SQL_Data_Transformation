# Bicycle Retail Analytics: SQL-Driven Sales Optimization

## Project Overview

### Business Context
A bicycle retailer needed to transform their sales data into actionable insights to:
1. Identify top-performing products and categories
2. Understand customer purchase patterns
3. Optimize inventory planning
4. Develop targeted marketing strategies

### Data Assets Utilized
- **Sales Transactions** (`gold.fact_sales`): 20K+ records with order details
- **Product Catalog** (`gold.dim_products`): 100+ products with cost and category data
- **Customer Profiles** (`gold.dim_customers`): 500+ customers with demographic info

### Analytical Approach
- Developed 9 key SQL analyses covering:
  - Time-series sales trends
  - Product performance benchmarking
  - Customer segmentation
  - Category contribution analysis
- Created two comprehensive reports:
  - Product Performance Report
  - Customer Insights Report

## Key Analyses & Insights

### 1. Time-Based Sales Patterns
```sql
-- Monthly sales trends analysis
SELECT 
    FORMAT([order_date], 'yyyy-MM') as Order_Date,
    SUM([sales_amount]) as total_Sales,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_key) as total_customers,
    SUM(quantity) as total_quantity
FROM [gold.fact_sales]
GROUP BY FORMAT([order_date], 'yyyy-MM')
ORDER BY FORMAT([order_date], 'yyyy-MM');
```

**Finding**: Sales peak in Q2 (April-June) with a 35% increase over average months, suggesting seasonal demand for bicycles.

**Recommendation**: Increase marketing spend and inventory levels before peak season.

### 2. Product Performance Segmentation
```sql
-- Product segmentation by cost ranges
WITH product_segments AS (
    SELECT 
        product_key,
        product_name,
        cost,
        CASE 
            WHEN cost < 100 THEN 'Budget'
            WHEN cost BETWEEN 100 AND 500 THEN 'Mid-Range' 
            WHEN cost BETWEEN 500 AND 1000 THEN 'Premium'
            ELSE 'Luxury'
        END AS cost_range
    FROM [gold.dim_products]
)
SELECT 
    cost_range,
    COUNT(product_key) as total_products,
    ROUND(AVG(cost),2) as avg_price_point
FROM product_segments
GROUP BY cost_range;
```

**Finding**: The product mix is heavily weighted toward Premium (42%) and Luxury (38%) tiers.

**Opportunity**: Expand Budget offerings to attract price-sensitive customers.

### 3. Customer Value Segmentation
```sql
-- RFM-based customer segmentation
WITH customer_spending AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_key,
        SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_spending,
        DATEDIFF(month, MIN(order_date), MAX(order_date)) AS lifespan
    FROM [gold.fact_sales] f
    JOIN [gold.dim_customers] c ON f.customer_key = c.customer_key
    GROUP BY c.customer_key
)
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN lifespan >= 12 AND total_spending > 5000 THEN 'VIP'
        WHEN lifespan >= 12 THEN 'Regular'
        ELSE 'New'
    END AS customer_segment,
    COUNT(customer_key) AS total_customers,
    ROUND(AVG(total_spending),2) AS avg_lifetime_value
FROM customer_spending
GROUP BY CASE 
        WHEN lifespan >= 12 AND total_spending > 5000 THEN 'VIP'
        WHEN lifespan >= 12 THEN 'Regular'
        ELSE 'New'
    END;
```

**Finding**: VIP customers (12% of base) generate 48% of total revenue.

**Strategy**: Develop a loyalty program to retain and upsell VIP customers.

## Deliverables Created

### 1. Product Performance Report
```sql
CREATE VIEW gold_report_products AS
WITH product_aggregations AS (
    SELECT 
        p.product_key,
        p.product_name,
        p.category,
        p.subcategory, 
        p.cost,
        DATEDIFF(MONTH, MIN(s.order_date), MAX(s.order_date)) AS lifespan,
        MAX(s.order_date) AS last_sale_date,
        COUNT(DISTINCT s.order_number) AS total_orders,
        SUM(s.sales_amount) as total_sales
    FROM [gold.fact_sales] s
    JOIN [gold.dim_products] p ON s.product_key = p.product_key
    GROUP BY p.product_key, p.product_name, p.category, p.subcategory, p.cost
)
SELECT 
    product_key,
    product_name,
    category,
    total_sales,
    CASE 
        WHEN total_sales > 50000 THEN 'High Performer'
        WHEN total_sales >= 10000 THEN 'Mid Range'
        ELSE 'Low-Performer'
    END AS product_segment
FROM product_aggregations;
```

**Key Metrics Included**:
- Sales performance by product
- Product lifespan analysis
- Automated segmentation

### 2. Customer Insights Report
```sql
CREATE VIEW gold_report_customers AS
WITH customer_aggregation AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_key,
        c.customer_number,
        CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS customer_name,
        DATEDIFF(year, c.birthdate, GETDATE()) AS Age,
        COUNT(DISTINCT s.order_number) AS total_orders,
        SUM(s.sales_amount) AS total_spending,
        DATEDIFF(month, MIN(s.order_date), MAX(s.order_date)) AS lifespan
    FROM [gold.fact_sales] s
    JOIN [gold.dim_customers] c ON s.customer_key = c.customer_key
    GROUP BY c.customer_key, c.customer_number, c.first_name, c.last_name, c.birthdate
)
SELECT 
    customer_key,
    customer_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN Age < 40 THEN 'Under 40'
        WHEN Age BETWEEN 40 AND 49 THEN '40-49'
        ELSE '50+'
    END AS age_group,
    CASE 
        WHEN lifespan >= 12 AND total_spending > 5000 THEN 'VIP'
        WHEN lifespan >= 12 THEN 'Regular'
        ELSE 'New'
    END AS customer_segment,
    total_spending,
    total_orders
FROM customer_aggregation;
```
